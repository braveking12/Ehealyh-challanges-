        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>
        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");{
                ohnoesSays.innerHTML ="<strong> oh Noes </strong> says he <em>lost alot of money millions,</em> due to the lost of a cargo ship in the sea ";
            }
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says"); {
                winstonSays.textContent="winston said, your a business man oh Noes i bet you have insurance because as a good business man you should have a risk management plan ";
            }
