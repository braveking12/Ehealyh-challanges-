        <h1>From Only the Eye Sees Blue</h1>
        <p>Seed in the landscape—
            not even the cruel cracks the geometric mirror.
            
            Slowly we watch the forms, figures there appearing,
            and the sun rises and sets—
            but passivity, lunar glass,
            only separates the horizontal from the sky.
            
            Ambiguous light lurks in green fish,
            in green waters,
            which sign will stir?
            
            In the depths of my throat
            I feel myself separate from the world
            because air is the open marrow.
            
            Frozen rivers flow and tremble
            while light lurks in the green fish,
            in the green waters
            like leaves from the trees of dreams.</p>
