        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first</strong> .<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us</em>.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <strong>Confusing. Trying. Struggling</strong> .<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
       <em> One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next</em>.<br>
        <strong> Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning</em> .<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are</em> .<br>
        </p>
        <p>
       <strong> <em>You only have to know one thing:</em></strong> <br>
        You can learn anything.
