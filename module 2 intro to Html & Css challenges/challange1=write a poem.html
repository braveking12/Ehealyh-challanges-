        <h1>From Only the Eye Sees Blue</h1>
        <p>Seed in the landscape— <br>
            not even the cruel cracks the geometric mirror. <br>
            
            Slowly we watch the forms, figures there appearing, <br>
            and the sun rises and sets— <br>
            but passivity, lunar glass, <br>
            only separates the horizontal from the sky. <br>
            
            Ambiguous light lurks in green fish, <br>
            in green waters, <br>
            which sign will stir? <br>
            
            In the depths of my throat <br>
            I feel myself separate from the world <br>
            because air is the open marrow. <br>
            
            Frozen rivers flow and tremble <br>
            while light lurks in the green fish, <br>
            in the green waters <br>
            like leaves from the trees of dreams.</p>
